# Recipe App API

## Introduction
The Recipe App API is a comprehensive digital solution designed to empower home cooks, culinary enthusiasts, and professional chefs with access to a wide array of recipes from around the globe. It serves as the backbone for a feature-rich application that allows users to discover, create, share, and manage recipes all in one place. As the lead architect behind this RESTful API, I have been involved in the full cycle of backend development, from conceptualization to deployment and integration.
